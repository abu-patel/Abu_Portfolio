      <description>What sets this model so aprt from tradiional approach ? Customer churn prediction models using machine learning classification have been developed predominantly by training and testing on one time slice of data. I trained models on multiple time slices of data and refer to this approach as multi-slicing. Results show that given the same time frame of data, multi-slicing significantly improves churn prediction performance compared to training on the entire data set as one time slice.</description>

“Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked the people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was audible, piercing the uproar like the fife’s derisive serenade: “Commence instantly!</description>

      <description>My name is Abuzar patel and I have been working in the data science field for the past year. I am a Masters student specializing in Data Science from Texas A&amp;amp;M University and have done several projects along with a Data Science Internship.
I transitioned into data science from a Engineering background. As it’s true that change is the only thing constant in life. I realized that embracing change is the only way to carve out a sustainable future.</description>

      <description>What sets this model so apart from tradiional approach ? Customer churn prediction models using machine learning classification have been developed predominantly by training and testing on one time slice of data. I trained models on multiple time slices of data and refer to this approach as multi-slicing. Results show that given the same time frame of data, multi-slicing significantly improves churn prediction performance compared to training on the entire data set as one time slice.</description>

      <title>Project II: Mobile Phone Price Classifier - A Multi Response Classification</title>

      <description>Created a tool for my STAT graduate level final project to classify price range of a mobile phone. I Optimized SVM Kernel, Radial, Random Forest, KNN, PCA and MultiNomial Logistic Regression to reach the best model and successfully received an A grade in the course.
I was able to get the model to predict with 95% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app.</description>

      <description>My name is Abuzar patel and I have been working in the data science field for the past year. I am a Masters student specializing in Data Science from Texas A&amp;amp;M University and have done several projects along with a Data Science Internship.
I transitioned into data science from a Engineering background. As itâ€™s true that change is the only thing constant in life. I realized that embracing change is the only way to carve out a sustainable future.</description>
